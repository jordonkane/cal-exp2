## Description
- A fitness tool used to display the user's caloric maintenance (a useful starting point for a diet).
- Uses the Harris-Benedict equation to accurately calculate the user's total daily energy expenditure.
- Input from the user includes: age, sex, weight, height, and activity level. (Imperial system) 
### Frameworks
- Uses JavaScript; HTML for the front-end.
## What I learned:
- The most important takeaway from this project is that I learned how to apply solution to a real-world problem. Dieting has always been mystified in media and is confusing to most people. This project serves as a very simple first step for someone looking to make a big lifestyle change, regardless of their age.
- On the technical side, this project has helped me sharpen my skills with managing forms in HTML and handling user input in JavaScript.
- I also learned more about design and how to make the interface look clean and usable with CSS.
